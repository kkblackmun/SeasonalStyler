## Top 3 App Ideas:

* ## Calorie Tracker App
    * Type: Health & Fitness
    * * **Mobile**:
        * *How uniquely mobile is the product experience?*
        
        Being able to track your food and add food on the go is a unique experience that would benefit from a mobile application because it allows for a quick and streamlined means. It's taxing and more clunky for the experience to be done on a website, and an app can store your daily intake, and keep track of your day. 
        * *What makes your app more than a glorified website?*
        Easily customizable drop down menus, editing to improve accuracy, and daily accumulation. Maybe post notifications reminding you to eat/take care of yourself. Similar exercise applications take partnerships with meditation companies and track stress levels to encourage more positive lifestyles. 

        * *Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc*
        Some competing apps allow you to scan bar codes to upload food data. Push notifications can remind you to eat/move. Editable workouts/burning calories which can then encourage use the data to suggest you get a snack you prefer.
        
    * **Story**:
        * *How compelling is the story around this app once completed?*
        
        "Hit your Macros"-- maybe to differentiate itself, we make the app prioritize protein or prioritize certain health goals/macro splits for training athletes. Then, the app can suggest recipes that align with those particular goals. Maybe even allow fitness influencers to post their diets, track their food, share their meals to friends with a photographic component?
        
        * *How clear is the value of this app to your audience?*
        
        The value would potentially be in maintaining your fitness goals with a fitness community. I think the value is questionable to audiences because an app like this already exists and people do use it, but I personally don't. A fan favorite is myfitnesspal, but to me, a lot of the app can be frustrating because you don't have much control on the caloric intake aside from height, weight, gender, and an estimation as to how active you are. But I don't feel like they're good indications as to how much or what types of food you should be eating by only looking at caloric intake.

        * *How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?*
        I'm not entirely sure. I have always been really into my fitness and personal health development for a variety of reasons, and I recognize not all of them are comfortable subjects of conversation. Thus, I know most of my friends may not be interested in this app, but I feel like the target audience isn't healthy carefree college students, rather people who are looking for guidance/help/support in their fitness journey.
        
    * **Market**:
        * *How large or unique is the market for this app?*
        
        The market seems large to me, as many people are always trying to improve their physiques and overall health.
        
        * *What's the size and scale of your potential user base?*
        An app like myfitnesspal, with similar success, can have an extremely large hold on users: with $310 million in revenue and 200 million users, there is a large market for health-aspiring individuals. 

        * *Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?*
        It definitely could. Supporting people to reaching their fitness goals in the shortest amount of time possible, but also allowing a means to specify those goals could provide immense value not just to powerlifters, body builders, and gymrats everywhere, but also to new gym comers, or those struggling to lose/gain weight.
        
        * *Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?*

        The audience is anyone who wants to reach their fitness goals as soon as possible.
        
    * **Habit**:
        * *How habit-forming or addictive is this app?*
        
        I think it can be very habit forming, as users will have control over planning their meals, reaching goals, and can check their progress throughout the day and over time.
        
        * *How frequently would an average user open and use this app?*
        
        Several times a day, at least 2-3/meal or 1/day to upload what they've eaten in a day.

        * *Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?*


        An average user would create their own meal sheets and track what they've eaten, but they wouldn't be obligated to create posts, make connections, or comment unless they wanted to.
    
    * **Scope**:
        * *How well-formed is the scope for this app?*
        
        Not super well-formed, but the competitors for this app are well-formed.
        
        * *How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?*
        
        A low fidelity version should be intermediately challenging for my current skillsets, but there are tutorials and resources that would be helpful.

        * *Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?*
        
        Yes. I think it definitely is.
        
        * *How clearly defined is the product you want to build?*
        Not super clearly defined.

* ## Show Catalog App- MyVirtualCloset
    * Type: Lifestyle - Fashion


    * **Mobile**:
        * *How uniquely mobile is the product experience?*
        
        Very uniquely mobile. Quick and easy to add your shoe and picture of shoe on your phone for easy access.
        
        * *What makes your app more than a glorified website?*
        The quick and easy way you can add your shoe, picture of shoe, and notes for the shoe.

        * *Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc*
        
        Camera, real-time update, and customizable shoe entried into the table.
        
    * **Story**:
        * *How compelling is the story around this app once completed?*
        
        Less compelling, its a utility for navigating through your shoes. Not many women have so many shoes they need an app to navigate it.
        
        * *How clear is the value of this app to your audience?*
        
        Value is high to women who have a lot of shoes they need to navigate through.

        * *How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?*
        
        My friends would think it's cool, but they wouldn't be into using it I think. They don't have enough shoes to warrant an app.
        
    * **Market**:
        * *How large or unique is the market for this app?*
        
        Market is smaller, but to a niche group of wealthy or clothes focused individuals, the app could be helpful in sorting through the perfect outfit planner.
        
        * *What's the size and scale of your potential user base?*
        Not sure, but I am sure it will resonate with high power people with lots of shoes for lots of occasions. 

        * *Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?*
        
        Huge value? No, but I think it will definitely provide good value- it should allow people to reduce time planning their outfits or deciding between their shoes.
        
        * *Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?*
        
        Not a super well-defined audience but a good idea.
        
    * **Habit**:
        * *How habit-forming or addictive is this app?*
        
        Not super habit-forming or addictive as is. It could be with push notifications or suggestions to wear certain shoes they haven't viewed in a long time.
        
        * *How frequently would an average user open and use this app?*
        
        An average user would probably use it once a day or every few days to pick the perfect shoe for their outfit.

        * *Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?*

        They create their particular items to store into the app, but they are mostly just consuming- they are not producing content.
    
    * **Scope**:
        * *How well-formed is the scope for this app?*
        
        Pretty well formed, it is mostly a table view, details view.
        
        * *How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?*
        
        Intermediately challenging, but relies mostly on what we've learned in class.

        * *Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?*
        
        Yes, i think so.
        
        * *How clearly defined is the product you want to build?*
        Not super clear but clearer than the passion project app I'm interested in.

* ## Color Seasonal AI Styler App
    * Type: Lifestyle
        * *Similar category to Pinterest which was only labeled as "free"*

    * **Mobile**:
        * *How uniquely mobile is the product experience?*
        
        Adjusting with a color picker and scrolling through clothing options makes the product experience uniquely mobile- or at least faster.
        
        * *What makes your app more than a glorified website?*
        Using your camera to upload a photo. 

        * *Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc*

    * **Story**:
        * *How compelling is the story around this app once completed?*
        
        Super interesting for sure. Using generative AI to typecast individual users into a particular clothing category is pretty cool. And if I am able to bring outfit suggestions or color palette suggestions to recommend stores or clothing products + links, I think it would revolutionize the shopping experience.
        
        * *How clear is the value of this app to your audience?*
        
        High value, for people to go to one app for a customized shopping experience.

        * *How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?*
        
        They respond well! They just, correctly, think it would be hard.
        
    * **Market**:
        * *How large or unique is the market for this app?*
        
        The market is broad and large to all people trying to up their shopping game and develop their individual style.
        
        * *What's the size and scale of your potential user base?*
        All people trying to get advice on their clothing style and want to change up their wardrobes.

        * *Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?*
        
        Yes! People spend tons of money on clothes they don't love, but they don't know why they don't- this would allow for a route to change their wardrobe.
        
        * *Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?*

        Not a well-defined audience, but a large audience of primarily women that would be interested in it.
        
    * **Habit**:
        * *How habit-forming or addictive is this app?*
        
        With the shopping aspect incorporated in, it would be incredibly addictive.
        
        * *How frequently would an average user open and use this app?*
        
        Probably every few days at least.

        * *Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?*
        
        They consume.
    
    * **Scope**:
        * *How well-formed is the scope for this app?*
        
        Not super well formed.
        
        * *How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?*
        
        Very technically challenging

        * *Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?*
        
        Yes, incredibly.
        
        * *How clearly defined is the product you want to build?*
        The color/season aspect is identified, but the product recommendation portion is not AT ALL.
